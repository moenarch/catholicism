# Introduction

The purpose of this website is to provide arguments for the Catholic Faith.
You can contribute very easily via the edit button on the upper right corner.

We try to put it into a hierarchical tree structure as much as possible, so that it can serve as a step-by-step guide into the faith.
However, some pieces of information don't fit in very well, they are used in multiple places.

If you want to find a specific piece of information, make sure to use the search function.
