# The Father gives all to the Son

1. The Father communicates all to the Son, except Paternity.
2. The Father spirates.
3. Therefore, The Son spirates.

In scripture we read:

> 13 When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all the truth; for he will not speak on his own authority, but whatever he hears he will speak, and he will declare to you the things that are to come. 
> 14 He will glorify me, for he will take what is mine and declare it to you. 
> 15 All that the Father has is mine; therefore I said that he will take what is mine and declare it to you.

John 16:13-15

## Premises

### Premise 1

We can split our explanation into two parts.
First: "The Father communicates all to the Son"; this is taken from "all that the Father has is mine" (John 16:15).

Secondly, we need to explain what is meant by "except Paternity".
The distinction of the two persons requires Paternity of the Father and Filiation of the Son.
Thus, before an argument about communication from the Father to the Son can be made, Paternity and Filiation must be fixed, so to speak, in order for there to be the Father and the Son.

### Premise 2

While Father and Son require Paternity and Filiation individually to be distinct, they can both have Spiration, and thus if we argue that the Father communicates *all* to the Son, except Paternity, then it also applies to Spiration.
