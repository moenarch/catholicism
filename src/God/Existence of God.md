# Existence of God

It is plain that the entirety of Catholicism hinges upon God, especially His existence.
Thus, we offer a brief overview over the arguments for the existence of God.



## Two-Phase Arguments

Arguments for the existence of God usually take two phases.
In the first phase, we establish the existence of something, let's call it $X$.
In the second phase, we show that $X$ has all of the Divine attributes, and therefore $X$ is God.
Then we conclude from (1) $X$ exists and (2) $X$ is God that God exists.

### Why two Phases?

At first, phase 2 may seem counter-intuitive, because identities like $A$ is $B$ or $B$ is $A$ are usually intuitive and don't require argumentation.
However, consider examples like 'Clark Kent is Superman' and 'Superman is Clark Kent'.
This isn't obvious to Lois Lane, but theoretically she could observe Clark Kent changing wardrope and flying around.
Likewise, she could observe Superman getting out of his suit and putting on glasses.

Of course, the Superman example isn't restricted to things which must first be observed.
The equality of two mathematical formulas $a$ and $b$ might not be obvious to us.
In order to establish the equality we either must transform $a$ to $b$ or $b$ to $a$, of course only with ways that preserve the value.
Simply speaking, if we see an unknown animal, and it quacks like a duck and walks like a duck, for all we know, it is a duck.

### Can the two phases be reversed?

Theoretically yes.
But usually, you want to stick to the direction.
There are similar two-phased arguments for other things, which first establish that $X$ is $Y$ and then that $X$ exists or something alike.

## Classes of Arguments

Apart from being two-phased, arguments are usually classified along various shared structures or lines of argumentation.
This way we can easier split objections into
1. objections against a specific premise of a singular argument, and
2. objections against the overall structure of this class of arguments.
